# Mind-Game-with-Raspberry-Pi-Pico-WH
üìçProject Overview
This project is a memory-based mind game built using Raspberry Pi Pico WH, 3 LEDs, 3 buttons, and an LCD screen. The game challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of LED colors using buttons, with the difficulty increasing at each level.

üñáÔ∏èComponents Used
-Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico WH
-LEDs: 3 (Red, Green, Blue)
-Buttons: 3 (one for each LED)
-LCD Screen: Used to display messages and game status
-Software IDE: Thonny IDE
-Programming Language: MicroPython

üéÆHow the Game Works
-Game Start: The game begins by selecting a random LED color.
-Level 1: The selected LED lights up. The player must press the corresponding button to proceed to the next level.
-Level 2: A second LED color is added to the sequence. The player must correctly press both buttons in the right order.
-Level 3 and Beyond: The sequence continues to grow, adding one new random color at each level.

üßæGame Rules:
-If the player fails to press the correct button in time, the LCD displays "Time Over", and the game resets.
-If the player presses the wrong button, the LCD displays "Game Over", and the game resets.
-If the player successfully completes all levels, the LCD displays "You Win!".
-Randomized LED sequence: Ensures a unique game experience every time.
-Real-time feedback: LCD screen displays game messages and current status.
-Incremental difficulty: Each level increases in complexity by adding a new LED color to the sequence.

üóÇÔ∏èInstallation and Setup
-Install Thonny IDE: Download and install Thonny IDE to program Raspberry Pi Pico WH.
-Set up MicroPython: Ensure MicroPython is installed on the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.
-Connect Components: Wire the LEDs, buttons, and LCD screen to the Raspberry Pi Pico WH.
-Upload the Code: Write and run the MicroPython script in Thonny IDE.
-Start Playing: Press the start button to begin the game.
